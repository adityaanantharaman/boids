# Boids Algorithm implemented using p5.js

In order to run the simulation on a local system.
1. clone the repository
2. run the index.html file

The boids.js file consists of implementation of the rules for each of the individual boids. These rules are implemented as functions align, cohese, repulse.

sketch.js consists of setting up the p5.js canvas and implementing the draw function as well as the controls for the parameters.
